Although we recommend Kali Linux for the best experience, it’s not mandatory.\nInstalling Linux If you choose to install Linux, we suggest using Kali Linux 2023.2, as it provides an optimized environment for our purpose. You can download it from the official Kali Linux website here.\nOR Setting Up a Virtual Machine If booting a live image is not an option for you, a virtual machine is an alternative solution. We recommend using VirtualBox. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\nInstall VirtualBox: Begin by installing VirtualBox on your system.\nDownload the Kali Linux Prebuilt Virtual Machine: Visit the official Kali Linux website here and download the prebuilt VirtualBox machine.\nAdd the VM to VirtualBox: Import the downloaded VM into VirtualBox.\nConnect Your USB Network Adapter: Please note that using a VM for this purpose requires a USB network adapter. If you can live boot, you can skip this section.\nBooting the VM: Once you’ve added the VM and connected your USB adapter, start the VM. To verify that your adapter is working correctly, open a terminal in Kali Linux and run the command ip a.\nWith your setup in place, you’re now ready to begin exploring WPA hijacking. First, let’s ensure that your Linux system is up-to-date. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:\nsudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Starting with Your Wireless Interface To ensure that your setup is ready for WPA hijacking and to determine whether you need a wireless adapter, follow these steps:\nOpen a terminal in Kali Linux.\nInstall aircrack-ng sudo apt install aircrack-ng (kali come preinstalled with aircrack-ng) this will install a list of ng packages.\nRun the following command to list available wireless interfaces:\nsudo airmon-ng now we will run the flowing command to start monitor mode use the name of your wireless interface: sudo airmon-ng start Note your wireless interface’s name (usually starts with “wlan”). If you see your wireless interface listed, and it matches the one you’ve connected to your USB adapter, then you’re all set. However, please be aware that monitor mode may not work with certain built-in wireless chips on your computer or laptop. If it’s not listed or monitor mode is not functioning as expected, you may need a compatible USB wireless adapter.\nNow that you’ve started monitor mode, you can use the following command to confirm that it’s working correctly: sudo iwconfig you made it this far I will explain the 3 componets of good WPA hijaking\nWPA Hijacking Components If you’ve made it this far, I’ll explain the three key components of successful WPA hijacking.\nComponent Description Deauthentication Deauthentication attacks disrupt the Wi-Fi connection between a client device and the access point by sending deauthentication packets. This can force the client to disconnect and potentially reconnect, enabling the attacker to capture handshake packets. Capturing Packet capturing involves intercepting and collecting network data packets, particularly the four-way handshake packets exchanged between a client and the access point during the connection setup. These packets contain the necessary information for a potential password recovery attempt. Hashing Hashing refers to the process of taking the captured four-way handshake packets and attempting to crack the Wi-Fi password. Tools like Aircrack-ng and Hashcat are commonly used for this purpose. The goal is to derive the original pre-shared key (PSK) used for WPA/WPA2 security. These three components are central to WPA hijacking and are typically executed in a systematic manner to gain unauthorized access to a secured Wi-Fi network.\nWorking with Bettercap Now that you understand the components, let’s explore how to use Bettercap for deauthentication and packet capturing. We’ll use Aircrack-ng for the hashing part.\nTo install Bettercap, use the following commands:\nsudo apt update sudo apt install bettercap Since we’re downloading tools, let’s also install Aircrack-ng. It comes preinstalled on Kali Linux, but you can ensure it’s up-to-date with the following:\nsudo apt update sudo apt install aircrack-ng To start up bettercap we will use your interface you can use the following command to get you interface:\nsudo iwconfig then we will start the bettecap terminal:\nsudo bettercap -iface this is will place us in the bettercap terminal\nwe will set our interface into monitor mode and start scanning in all sopported fequencies:\nwifi.recon on to view the Access Points(APs) and the number of clints on a list we run:\nset wifi.show ","wordCount":"777","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://andmecarlos.com/posts/wpa-hijacking/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Carlos Nunez","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://andmecarlos.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://andmecarlos.com/ accesskey=h title="> $  cd /Home/ (Alt + H)"><img src=https://andmecarlos.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>> $ cd /Home/</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
